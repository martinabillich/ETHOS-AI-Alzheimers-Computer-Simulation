## Comparing the performance of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to predict time-to-event: A simulation study for conversion to mild cognitive impairment

This repository serves as a hub for the code related to our simulation study, a crucial component of our ongoing research - **_Comparing the performance of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to predict time-to-event: A simulation study for conversion to mild cognitive impairment_**. <br>
In our exploration of this topic, we have developed and implemented a range of simulation scenarios to rigorously evaluate and contrast the performance of various survival analysis techniques. The code and resources provided here are intended to facilitate transparency and reproducibility in our research, as well as to offer a valuable resource for fellow researchers interested in this field.

The code in this repository is implemented using Python within a Jupyter notebook environment. In our research, we utilized the capabilities of the [PySurvival](https://square.github.io/pysurvival/) Python library, both for implementing survival analysis models and for generating the necessary data. While parts of our code for simulating data are adapted from the open-source PySurvival library, other sections of the code represent original work that we have developed. This combination of existing tools and our own contributions ensures the robustness and reliability of our methodology.

### Requirements
PySurvival is compatible with Python version 2.7 - 3.7
